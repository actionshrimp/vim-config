INSTALLATION						*xpath-installation*

To install the plugin, extract the directory structure into your vimfiles, or 
source the |vimball|.

For the plugin to run, you'll need python support enabled. You can check this
with |:version|, and looking for +python.

You'll also need python-lxml installed (ideally 2.7 or higher).

Without these the plugin will let you know on startup, then stop loading.

==============================================================================
USAGE							*xpath-usage*

When you open a file which the plugin recognises (by default: xml, xslt - to 
define additional filetypes see |xpath-configure|), the mapping X in normal
mode will launch an XPath search prompt. Type your xpath in here, then hit 
<Enter> to open a new results window.

The search prompt supports context-sensitive tab completion. To tab complete
attributes in the current context, type an @ sign at the beginning of the
current context (e.g. //Parent/Child/@<Tab> will complete all attributes
for Child).

When you do a search, the cursor will jump to the first result in the results
window. If the result has a line number, you can also press <Enter> on the
highlighted result, and the cursor will jump to the line in your XML file
that matched the search.

If the XML file is not valid, the plugin will let you know of any XML 
validation errors. Again if there is a line number associated with the error
you can hit <Enter> to jump there.

Pressing X in normal mode on the results window will cause it to close again.

XPath search defines several functions, but the main interface to the plugin 
is through the XPathSearchPrompt() function, which launches the search input 
prompt.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION						*xpath-configure*

To disable the plugin for certain situtations, add the following in your
.vimrc:

let g:loaded_xpath = 1

To add additional filetypes to add the normal mode X mapping to, append a list
of the filetypes to the g:xpath_search_filetypes variable. For example, to 
enable the plugin for htm and html files, you can use the following:

let g:xpath_search_filetypes += ['htm', 'html']

To display the filetype for a file you currently have open in order to set up 
a new match, you can use the command :set filetype.
